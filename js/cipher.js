/**
 * cipher.js — Cryptographic core for Remnant's Cipher feature.
 *
 * A Cipher is a Remnant whose content is encrypted client-side with a
 * user-supplied passphrase. This module is the ONLY place that touches
 * the actual cryptography — key derivation and AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt.
 * Nothing here knows about the UI, the nav tree, or the spotlight-reveal
 * rendering; it just turns (passphrase, plaintext) into a storable
 * encrypted record, and turns (passphrase, record) back into plaintext.
 *
 * ── Security model — read this before touching anything below ──────
 *
 * - The passphrase is NEVER stored, anywhere, in any form. Not in
 *   localStorage, not in the KV sync payload, not even hashed for a
 *   "remember me" feature. The only thing ever persisted is the salt
 *   (not secret — it just needs to be known to re-derive the same key),
 *   the KDF parameters, and the per-line IVs/ciphertexts.
 * - There is NO recovery path. A forgotten passphrase means permanently
 *   lost content. This is load-bearing, not a missing feature — any
 *   "reset" mechanism that could recover the plaintext would mean the
 *   encryption was never actually protecting anything.
 * - Key derivation: Argon2id (via the vendored hash-wasm build —
 *   vendor/argon2.umd.min.js, fetched and checksum-verified from the
 *   official npm registry, MIT licensed). Parameters below are tuned for
 *   CLIENT-SIDE, REPEATED use (every unlock, on whatever device the user
 *   has, not a one-time server-side login) — see ARGON2_PARAMS for the
 *   reasoning. Argon2id was chosen over PBKDF2 because it's memory-hard,
 *   which specifically defeats cheap massively-parallel GPU/ASIC
 *   brute-forcing of the kind PBKDF2 has grown weaker against over time.
 * - Encryption: AES-256-GCM via the browser's native Web Crypto API.
 *   Authenticated — a wrong key fails decryption outright (throws)
 *   rather than silently producing corrupted plaintext, which is exactly
 *   the signal needed to tell a user "wrong passphrase" with confidence.
 *   Native means no additional library/trust surface for this half.
 *
 * ── PER-LINE encryption (this is the load-bearing design choice) ───────
 * A Cipher's body is encrypted ONE LINE AT A TIME, not as a single blob.
 * Every line shares the same derived key but gets its OWN fresh random
 * IV — reusing a key across many independently-IV'd ciphertexts is the
 * normal, correct use of AES-GCM (nonce-per-message), not a special case.
 *
 * Why: this is what lets the spotlight-reveal UI (app.js) decrypt only
 * the line currently under the cursor, on demand, and let every other
 * line sit as genuine ciphertext bytes the rest of the time — not just
 * a substring of a string that's already fully decrypted in memory. A
 * memory snapshot taken at a random moment shows nearly the whole
 * document as ciphertext, with only the active line's plaintext ever
 * existing — a meaningfully smaller exposure footprint than decrypting
 * the whole body once at unlock.
 *
 * Saving an edit re-encrypts the ENTIRE line array together (not a diff
 * of just the changed lines) — simpler, and the per-line-at-rest
 * property is what matters between saves; diffing buys little extra
 * for real added complexity (line-shift bugs on insert/delete).
 *
 * ── Cipher record shape (what gets stored in IndexedDB / synced to KV) ──
 *   {
 *     salt:      base64 string, 16 random bytes, unique per Cipher,
 *                permanent for the Cipher's lifetime
 *     kdfParams: { memorySize, iterations, parallelism, hashLength } —
 *                not secret, just need to be known to re-derive the
 *                exact same key later (see deriveKey's comment on why
 *                THIS RECORD'S OWN stored params must always be used,
 *                never the live ARGON2_PARAMS constant)
 *     lines: [
 *       { iv: base64 string (12 bytes), ciphertext: base64 string },
 *       ...  one entry per line of the plaintext body, in order
 *     ]
 *   }
 *
 * API (all async):
 *   Cipher.deriveKey(passphrase, salt, kdfParams) → CryptoKey
 *   Cipher.createRecord(passphrase, plaintext)    → { record, key }
 *                                                    (plaintext is split
 *                                                    on \n; generates a
 *                                                    fresh salt)
 *   Cipher.decryptRecord(passphrase, record)      → { plaintext, key }
 *                                                    (joins lines with \n;
 *                                                    throws WRONG_PASSPHRASE)
 *   Cipher.decryptLineWithKey(key, lineRecord)    → string
 *                                                    (decrypt ONE line —
 *                                                    this is what the
 *                                                    spotlight reveal
 *                                                    calls on demand)
 *   Cipher.encryptLinesWithKey(key, lines[], salt, kdfParams) → record
 *                                                    (re-encrypt the
 *                                                    whole line array,
