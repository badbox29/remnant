/**
 * markdown.js — Pure Markdown parsing/rendering core for Remnant's
 * live-preview body editor.
 *
 * This module has NO DOM dependency at all — every function here is
 * (text in) -> (classification / HTML string out), nothing more. The
 * contentEditable wiring, cursor tracking, and "which construct is the
 * cursor currently inside" logic all live in app.js; this module doesn't
 * know contentEditable exists. Keeping it pure means the parsing/
 * rendering rules can be fully unit-tested without a browser, and the
 * eventual Export feature can reuse this same module to know what
 * Remnant considers valid Markdown, without dragging in any editor code.
 *
 * ── Scope (this pass): BLOCK-level constructs only ──────────────────
 * Inline emphasis (bold/italic/strikethrough/inline code/links) is a
 * deliberately separate, later pass — see the Markdown Support spec
 * discussion. Supporting it requires sub-line cursor-region tracking
 * that's a meaningfully different problem from "is this whole line a
 * header," so block and inline are built and tested independently
 * rather than risking both at once.
 *
 * Supported block constructs, in priority order (first match wins):
 *   - Fenced code block   ```...``` / ~~~...~~~ (multi-line; see below)
 *   - Header               # through ######
 *   - Horizontal rule       ---, ***, or ___ (a line of 3+ of one char)
 *   - Blockquote            > text
 *   - Unordered list item   - text / * text / + text
 *   - Ordered list item     1. text (any digits, not just "1")
 *   - Plain paragraph line  (no construct recognized — shown as-is)
 *
 * ── The governing rule for ALL of this — read before changing anything ──
 * A line either matches a supported construct's syntax EXACTLY, or it
 * renders as plain literal text. There is no fuzzy matching, no partial
 * credit, no attempt to guess what the user "probably meant." Example:
 * "### Heading ##" (mismatched closing hashes) is not a header — it's
 * shown character-for-character as typed. This is a deliberate product
 * decision (see spec discussion), not a parser limitation: silently
 * correcting or guessing intent would make the editor unpredictable in
 * exactly the moments a user most needs it to be predictable — when
 * something looks wrong on screen and they're trying to fix it.
 *
 * ── Fenced code blocks are the one multi-line construct ─────────────
 * Every other construct here is single-line: a header is one line, a
 * list item is one line (even though several consecutive list items
 * visually form "a list", each item is its own independent renderable
 * unit — see classifyLine). A fenced code block is different: it isn't
 * "done" until its closing fence appears, so it must be identified as a
 * BLOCK of lines together, not line-by-line. segmentIntoBlocks() is what
 * does this grouping; classifyLine() alone would have no way to know
 * "is this fence opening or closing something."
 *
 * ── API ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   Markdown.classifyLine(line)        → { type, render() } — see below
 *   Markdown.segmentIntoBlocks(text)   → Block[] — groups raw text into
 *                                         renderable units; multi-line
 *                                         fenced code blocks are ONE
 *                                         Block, everything else is one
 *                                         Block per line.
 *   Markdown.renderBlock(block)        → HTML string for that block
 *   Markdown.escapeHtml(str)           → HTML-escapes text content so
 *                                         raw Markdown source (which may
 *                                         contain <, >, & etc.) is never
 *                                         interpreted as real HTML when
 *                                         inserted into the DOM.
 *
 * Block shape: { type, raw, lines } where:
 *   - raw is the original, UNMODIFIED source text for this block,
 *     newline-joined if multi-line — this is what gets written back
 *     when the construct reverts to its editable/raw state, so it is
 *     byte-for-byte what the user typed, never a re-serialization.
 *   - lines is the raw text split into its constituent lines (length 1
 *     for every construct except fenced code blocks).
 *   - type is one of: 'code', 'header', 'hr', 'blockquote', 'ul', 'ol',
 *     'paragraph'
